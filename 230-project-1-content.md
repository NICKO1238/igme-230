## 6. Gameplay
### 1. Mechanics:   
   Player can move a pebble left, right, up, or down to make three or more of the same pebbles match up.
    Also if added later there will be an egg bonus that gives extra points and works as any pebble.
### 2. Control:
   Touch with finger swipe
### 3. Teaching the game:
   They will learn how to play by clicking a instructions button at the home page that will teach them to play.
    Telling them things like click and swipe to have pebbles switch places and which pebbles give the most points etc.
### 4. Player Learning:
   The player should take the choices and think ahead about what will get them the most points with comboing more pebbles together and 
   focusing on the better pebbles. The player should also be thining about how to use the egg power up. There really isnt a way to beat 
   the game other than increasing your chances for the love interest to accept the pebble with your score. 
## 7. Screenshots
    filler sentence until I add hand drawen work later
## 8. Other
  Based on the score at the end that is on the pebble persented to the love interest. I figured i could use a random function to 
  have it be the higher the score the better chance the girl penguin accepts the pebble. Also there can be a timer on each round 
  and the player needs to have so much points to move on.
